# Customer Support Ticket System

This project is a Customer Support Ticket System built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
It demonstrates fetching and displaying unresolved customer tickets from an external API using `async/await` for asynchronous operations. 
The system includes robust error handling with `try/catch` and uses `throw` to trigger custom error messages when no tickets are available. 
A `finally` block ensures cleanup actions, like hiding loading indicators, always occur. 
This project showcases essential skills for handling asynchronous data, managing errors gracefully, and dynamically updating the webpage based on API responses.
